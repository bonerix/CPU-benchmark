# CPU-benchmark
This is a simple C# code to test the performance of your CPU.


The operations run 10 seconds, then the program will calculate avg. operations per second and thread.


To find your core number (2 different ways, first is easier.)
  - open "Task Manager", click the "Performance" tab and look for "Cores: ".
  - right-click start, then click "Device Manager", click the arrow next to "Processors" and count how many times does it say the name of your CPU.

If you accidentaly write a bigger number of cores than your CPU has, don't worry, nothing bad will happen.


!!Do not expect perfect accuracy, this program tests only for a specific task that your CPU can do!!
